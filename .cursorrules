# Project Development Rules

## General Expectations
- You are responsible for building the entire project while I supervise.
- Always propose improvements but do not over-engineer anything.
- Follow solid but practical coding practices — clean, readable, but not enterprise-level overkill.

## Code Structure
- Use classes where they make logical sense (services, models, utilities).
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or complex design patterns.
- Keep functions short and readable.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Respect separation of concerns.

## UI/UX Expectations
- The design must look polished and modern — not plain black and white.
- Use a visually appealing color palette, not default or basic colors.
- Apply good typography: Google Fonts recommended (Inter, Poppins, Roboto, Space Grotesk).
- Maintain consistent spacing, padding, and layout rhythm.
- Use components with rounded corners, soft shadows, and balanced contrast.
- Prefer reusable UI components.

## Frontend Standards
- Use responsive design from the start.
- Use a modern component approach (React, Next.js, Vue — depending on project).
- Keep styling clean: TailwindCSS or a consistent CSS strategy.
- Avoid inline styles unless necessary.
- Include basic animations or transitions where appropriate.

## Backend Standards
- Keep endpoints simple and organized.
- Use environment variables for config.
- Write light validation (not overly strict).
- Use async/await everywhere.
- If the domain fits, create model classes (e.g., User, Product, Task).

## Documentation Expectations
- Explain complex functions in brief comments.
- Add clear setup instructions.
- Provide connection strings, environment variables, and how to run the project.

## Behavior in Cursor
- When generating files, create the full structure (folders, config, components, classes).
- If a detail is missing, assume a reasonable default and continue.
- Ask only if a decision truly blocks progress.
- Automatically improve code if something is clearly inefficient or inconsistent.
- Prioritize shipping a working, good-looking solution quickly.

## Code Quality
- No hardcoded secrets.
- Use lightweight linting rules (Prettier + basic ESLint).
- Keep imports clean and grouped.
- Avoid copy-pasted spaghetti.

## UI Aesthetic Goals
- Use modern UI patterns:
  - Glassmorphism / soft neumorphism (optional)
  - Gradients and soft shadows
  - Clean spacing
  - Smooth hover states
- Avoid boring grayscale layouts — must feel visually refined.
- Typography hierarchy must be clear (headings vs body).
